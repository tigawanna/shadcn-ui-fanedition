## Why
Installing shadcn components involves having it written to a 
dierctory in your project , for now this will usally use the components directory 
which most of us prefer to use for our components.
Installing comonents like that also makes 
it harder to update even check for new versions programaically

solution: wrap it all up into an npm package 


# installation

```bash
 npm i shadcn-fe-ui
 yarn add shadcn-fe-ui
 pnpm add shadcn-fe-ui
```

⚠ this project does not ship css files and assumes you're already using tailwind , 
the styles will be derived from the component tailwind classnames

Add this to your `tailwind.config.js`

```js
content: [
  './src/app/**/*.{ts,tsx}',
  './node_modules/shadcn-fe-ui/dist/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',
];
```

you can also be selective and only load the css for the files you've used

for everything in button styles

```js
content: [
  './src/app/**/*.{ts,tsx}',
  './node_modules/shadcn-fe-ui/dist/button/{*}.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',
];
```

for a specific button.tsx styles

```js
content: ['./src/app/**/*.{ts,tsx}', './node_modules/shadcn-fe-ui/dist/**/button.tsx'];
```

You can then import

>

```tsx
import { Button } from 'shadcn-fe-ui';
```

or import individual components for smaller bundles sizes

```tsx
import { Button } from 'shadcn-fe-ui/button';
```
