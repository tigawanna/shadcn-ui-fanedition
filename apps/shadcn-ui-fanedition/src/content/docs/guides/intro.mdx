## Why
 [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) is a great project that makes building a flexible design system with radix and tailwindcss a breeze.
 But it's a fairly new project and they're still trying to figure out how to manage it effeciently .
 so instead of making it even harder for them as they're recieving a lot of PRs .
 i went on an adventure and put this together based on my common use cases
