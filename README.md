# SHADCN/UI FAN EDITION

A fan edition of the awesome [SHADCN/UI](https://github.com/shadcn/ui)

includes

- [NPM components](https://github.com/tigawanna/shadcn-ui-fanedition/tree/master/packages/ui)
  loading the components into your project directly is nice but can get tedious and needs manual updating
  so instead

  ```js
  npm i shadcnfe-components
  ```

- [CLI](https://github.com/tigawanna/shadcn-ui-fanedition/tree/master/packages/cli)
  just like the OG cli but with a shad.config.json to persist your path prefernces
